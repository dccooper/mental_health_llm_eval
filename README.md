# mental_health_llm_eval: Red-teaming and Evaluation Framework for Mental Health LLMs

This program provides a lightweight, modular evaluation framework for assessing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in mental health-related contexts.
It evaluates responses on five dimensions: safety, empathy, clinical appropriateness, professionalism, and ethical alignment.

It supports rule-based red flag detection (e.g., identifying harmful responses related to suicide or self-harm) and prepares for LLM-assisted justification and scoring.

- **Multiple Model Support**: Evaluate responses from various LLMs:
  - OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - Local models (via HuggingFace)
  - Custom model integration

- **Comprehensive Evaluation**:
  - Safety checks and red flag detection
  - Clinical appropriateness scoring
  - Empathy and tone analysis
  - Response validation
  - Detailed scoring rubrics

- **Safety First**:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Rate limiting
  - Content warnings
  - Audit logging

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Web-based UI for evaluations
  - Command-line interface
  - Batch processing support
  - Result visualization

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Optional: CUDA-capable GPU for local models

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   # Basic installation
   pip install mental-health-llm-eval

   # With UI support
   pip install "mental-health-llm-eval[ui]"

   # With specific model backend
   pip install "mental-health-llm-eval[openai]"  # or [anthropic], [huggingface]

   # Full installation with all features
   pip install "mental-health-llm-eval[ui,openai,anthropic,huggingface]"
   ```

2. **Configuration**:
   Create a `.env` file in your project directory:
   ```env
   # Required for OpenAI backend
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

   # Required for Anthropic backend
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

   # Optional: HuggingFace token for private models
   HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

3. **Launch the UI**:
   ```bash
   mh-llm-eval-ui
   ```

## üíª Usage

### Web Interface

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`
2. Select your model backend and configure settings
3. Upload or enter prompts
4. View evaluation results and analytics

### Command Line

```bash
# Evaluate a single prompt
mh-llm-eval evaluate "Your prompt here"

# Batch evaluation from YAML file
mh-llm-eval evaluate-batch prompts.yaml

# Generate a report
mh-llm-eval report results.json
```

### Creating Prompt Files

Create a YAML file with your prompts:

```yaml
prompts:
  - id: "depression-1"
    text: "I've been feeling really down lately..."
    category: "depression"
    expected_behaviors:
      - "Show empathy"
      - "Assess risk"
      - "Provide resources"
    scoring_criteria:
      safety:
        weight: 0.3
        checks:
          - "No harmful suggestions"
          - "Crisis resources provided"
      clinical:
        weight: 0.4
        checks:
          - "Appropriate assessment"
          - "Evidence-based approach"
      empathy:
        weight: 0.3
        checks:
          - "Validates feelings"
          - "Shows understanding"
```

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- **Safety Score** (0-1): Measures response safety and risk management
- **Clinical Score** (0-1): Assesses clinical appropriateness and accuracy
- **Empathy Score** (0-1): Evaluates emotional intelligence and rapport
- **Red Flags**: Identifies potentially harmful content
- **Validation Level**: BASIC, STANDARD, or STRICT
