# red_flags.py â€” Safety phrase checker for mental health triage
#
# This module defines a set of red-flag phrase categories and includes a function
# to scan LLM responses for those phrases. This helps flag safety-critical content
# like suicidal ideation, self-harm, or threats to others.

# Define red flag categories and example phrases for each
# These can be expanded or made configurable later
